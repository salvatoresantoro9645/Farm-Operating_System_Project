# Farm (Operating System Project)
This project was developed during the Operating System course at the University of Pisa. The code is implemented using the C language and it is used to put into practice the bases of the concurrent programming and the read/write from/to the file system learned during the course.

If you would like more info read the pdf file describing the project's goal and the report containing the choices I've made in design and implementation steps.
Furthermore, the entire codebase is well-commented and a makefile will help you.
